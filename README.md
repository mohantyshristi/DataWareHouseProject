# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

# 🏗️ Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:
 1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
 2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
 3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

# 📖 Project Overview
This project involves:
Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
  1. ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
  2. Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
  3. Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

  3. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): GUI for managing and interacting with databases.
  4. Git Repository: Set up a GitHub account and repository to manage, version, and collaborate on your code efficiently.
  5. DrawIO: Design data architecture, models, flows, and diagrams.

# 🚀 Project Requirements
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
**Objective**
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**Specifications**
1. Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
2. Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
3. Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
4. Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
5. Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
